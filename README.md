PREDICTIVE MODELING – FORECAST LIKE A DATA PRO

How to process own dataset
1. How to handle missing vales I.e. I. Dropping or ii. Imputation
2. Data standardardization
3. Label encoding
4. Handling imbalanced dataset

NB: Splitting data into two parts( training and testing)

Data Standardisation
The process of standardising the data to a common format or common range.
When we make a standard deviation of our dataset closer to 1.

Numpy - It is a library used to play with numbers.
Pandas- It is a library used to handle datasets in python.

.fit = is used to fit our dataset into a particular range
.transform = is used to transform our dataset into a particular range

Label Encoding
fit_transform changes the original dataset to numerical value .inverse-transform is used to convert it back to original value
